| ----------------- | -------- | -------- | 

This is a Zigbee temperature monitor, in my case used for a freezer. The design supports up to
four ds18b20s. The only other component required is a 4.7kohm resistor between data and Vcc.

As built:
1 - esp32-C6 Super Mini.
1 - 4.7kohm resistor
4 - ds18b20s temperature probes
